### Coding conventions

Start reading my code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

* PSR-2 Coding Standard - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to run `make phplint`, which uses [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
* ESLINT Coding Syntax - Please have your IDE / Text editor respect the eslint as I won't accept a PR that is not compliant. 
    * For weight's sake, eslint node package isn't included in the repository, but please have alook at [eslintrc.js](eslintrc.js) file.
